# SQL_project_1
This project builds a structured database from a retail sales analysis csv file and extracts insights using SQL. The data was cleaned to handle duplicates, missing values, and inconsistencies. SQL analysis identified sales trends, category performance, shift-wise orders, and revenue rankings for decision-making.
