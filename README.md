# Retail Sales Analysis SQL Project

## Project Overview

**Project Title**: Retail Sales Analysis  
**Database**: `sql_project_1`

This project is designed to demonstrate SQL skills and techniques typically used by data analysts to explore, clean, and analyze retail sales data. The project involves setting up a retail sales database, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and answering specific business questions through SQL queries. This project is ideal for those who are starting their journey in data analysis and want to build a solid foundation in SQL.

## Objectives

1. **Set up a retail sales database**: Create and populate a retail sales database with the provided sales data.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Identify and remove any records with missing or null values.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform basic exploratory data analysis to understand the dataset.
4. **Business Analysis**: Use SQL to answer specific business questions and derive insights from the sales data.

## Project Structure

### 1. Database Setup

- **Database Creation**: The project starts by creating a database named `sql_project_1`.
- **Table Creation**: A table named `retail_prices` is created to store the sales data. The table structure includes columns for transaction ID, sale date, sale time, customer ID, gender, age, product category, quantity sold, price per unit, cost of goods sold (COGS), and total sale amount.

```sql
CREATE DATABASE sql_project_1;

CREATE TABLE retail_prices(
transactions_id	integer primary key,
sale_date	date,
sale_time	time,
customer_id	integer,
gender	varchar(10),
age	integer,
category varchar(15),	
quantiy	integer,
price_per_unit	float,
cogs	float,
total_sale float
);
```

### 2. Data Exploration & Cleaning

- **Record Count**: Determine the total number of records in the dataset.
- **Customer Count**: Find out how many unique customers are in the dataset.
- **Category Count**: Identify all unique product categories in the dataset.
- **Null Value Check**: Check for any null values in the dataset and delete records with missing data.

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_sales  from retail_prices;
SELECT COUNT(distinct(customer_id)) from retail_prices;
SELECT DISTINCT(category) from retail_prices;

SELECT * FROM retail_prices
WHERE 
   transactions_id IS NULL or sale_date IS NULL or sale_time IS NULL
or customer_id IS NULL or gender IS NULL or age IS NULL
or category IS NULL or quantiy IS NULL or price_per_unit IS NULL
or cogs IS NULL or total_sale IS NULL;

DELETE FROM retail_prices
WHERE 
    transactions_id IS NULL or sale_date IS NULL or sale_time IS NULL
or customer_id IS NULL or gender IS NULL or age IS NULL
or category IS NULL or quantiy IS NULL or price_per_unit IS NULL
or cogs IS NULL or total_sale IS NULL;

```

### 3. Data Analysis & Findings

The following SQL queries were developed to answer specific business questions:

1. **Write a SQL query to retrieve all columns for sales made on '2022-11-05**:
```sql
select * from retail_prices
where sale_date='2022-11-05';
```

2. **Write a SQL query to retrieve all transactions where the category is 'Clothing' and the quantity sold is more than 4 in the month of Nov-2022**:
```sql
select transactions_id,category,quantiy,sale_date from retail_prices where 
category='Clothing' and quantiy>=4 and to_char(sale_date,'YYYY-MM')='2022-11';
```

3. **Write a SQL query to calculate the total sales (total_sale) for each category.**:
```sql
select sum(total_sale) as price,category from retail_prices group by category;
```

4. **Write a SQL query to find the average age of customers who purchased items from the 'Beauty' category.**:
```sql
select avg(age) from retail_prices where category ='Beauty';
```

5. **Write a SQL query to find all transactions where the total_sale is greater than 1000.**:
```sql
select transactions_id,total_sale from
retail_prices where total_sale>1000;
```

6. **Write a SQL query to find the total number of transactions (transaction_id) made by each gender in each category**:
```sql
select count(transactions_id),gender,category from retail_prices
 group by gender,category order by category;
```

7. **Write a SQL query to calculate the average sale for each month. Find out best selling month in each year**:
```sql
select year,month,average_sales  from
(select extract(year from sale_date) as year,extract(month from sale_date) as month,avg(total_sale) as average_sales,
rank()over(partition by extract(year from sale_date) order by avg(total_sale) desc) as rank
from retail_prices group by 1,2	 /*order by 1,3 desc;*/)
as t1
where rank=1;
```

8. **Write a SQL query to find the top 5 customers based on the highest total sales **:
```sql
select sum(total_sale),customer_id from retail_prices
 group by customer_id order by sum(total_sale) desc limit 5;

```

9. **Write a SQL query to find the number of unique customers who purchased items from each category.**:
```sql
select count(distinct customer_id),category
 from retail_prices group by category;
```

10. ** Write a SQL query to create each shift and number of orders (Example Morning <=12, Afternoon Between 12 & 17, Evening >17)**:
```sql
with hourly_sale as(
select *,case
     when extract(hour from sale_time)<12 then 'morning'
	 when extract(hour from sale_time) between 12 and 17 then 'afternoon'
	 else 'evening'
	 end as shift from retail_prices)
	 select shift,count(transactions_id) as count_of_sales from hourly_sale group by shift;
```

## Findings

- **Customer Demographics**: The dataset includes customers from various age groups, with sales distributed across different categories such as Clothing and Beauty.
- **High-Value Transactions**: Several transactions had a total sale amount greater than 1000, indicating premium purchases.
- **Sales Trends**: Monthly analysis shows variations in sales, helping identify peak seasons.
- **Customer Insights**: The analysis identifies the top-spending customers and the most popular product categories.

## Reports

- **Sales Summary**: A detailed report summarizing total sales, customer demographics, and category performance.
- **Trend Analysis**: Insights into sales trends across different months and shifts.
- **Customer Insights**: Reports on top customers and unique customer counts per category.

## Conclusion

This project serves as a comprehensive introduction to SQL for data analysts, covering database setup, data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and business-driven SQL queries. The findings from this project can help drive business decisions by understanding sales patterns, customer behavior, and product performance.
